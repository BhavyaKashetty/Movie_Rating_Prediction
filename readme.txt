Readme file for executing our project: Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

Compile and Run the code in command line

python ML_Project.py <Target_user> <kNN value> <path to ratings file> <path to movies file>
Eg:
python ML_Project.py 10 100 E:\Machine_learning\Final_project\ratings.csv E:\Machine_learning\Final_project\movies.csv

Target_user - Target users available in the data set are: 1-610
Eg:10,15,20,28,132
kNN value - kNN should be an integer value that range from any value in between 1-609
path to ratings file - Should be complete path of the ratings file provided in the dataset
path to movies file - Should be complete path of the movies file provided in the dataset

Output for user-based and item-based filtering algorithms is computed using the above parameters.

More details about the results are provided in the Report file.
